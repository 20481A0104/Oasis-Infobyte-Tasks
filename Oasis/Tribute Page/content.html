            <blockquote>
                "The true revolutionary is guided by a great feeling of love. It is impossible to think of a genuine
                revolutionary lacking this quality."
            </blockquote>
            <blockquote>
                "If you tremble with indignation at every injustice, then you are a comrade of mine."
            </blockquote>
            <blockquote>
                "The revolution is not an apple that falls when it is ripe. You have to make it fall."
            </blockquote>
            <blockquote>
                "At the risk of seeming ridiculous, let me say that the true revolutionary is guided by great feelings
                of love."
            </blockquote>
            <blockquote>
                "Many will call me an adventurer, and that I am...only one of a different sort: one of those who risks
                his skin to prove his truths."
            </blockquote>
            <blockquote>
                "The revolution is made through human beings, but individuals must forge their revolutionary spirit day
                by day."
            </blockquote>
            <blockquote>
                "I knew that the moment the great governing spirit strikes the blow to divide all humanity into just two
                opposing factions, I would be on the side of the common people."
            </blockquote>
